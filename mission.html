        <h2>Why we are Smart Photography ?</h2>
        <p>Matt and I first teamed up in 2008 as part of the Indiana University Hoosiermama?s ultimate frisbee team.
        Upon learning that we both had a passion for nature we joined the IU Underwater Science department. It was 
        there that we began shooting photography. Whether it was site surveys or macro shots of corals and fish, we
         were always ready to go with a camera. After graduating, we continued to arm ourselves with cameras wherever
          we went.</p>
        <h2>What you should expect ?</h2>
        <p> Each month Wild Boyz Photography will bring you a new nonprofit partner to learn about, and provide an album
             of nature photography
         Wild Boyz Photography is a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The goal of WBP is to provide you with a unique perspective on
          nature through photography and storytelling. 75% of your donation goes to our featured non-profit. We will feature
           a different non-profit each month. The remaining 25% of your donation goes to WBP. We use this to offset our 
           operational expenses. 
            
            Please consider donating today.</p>
