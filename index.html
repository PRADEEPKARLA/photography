    <h2>what is photography</h2>
    <p>Since the first photograph was taken in 1826, creators have been using this skill to capture images of the 
        world around them. Photography allows people to document events, moments in time, and things they have seen.
         It can also help human beings gain a better understanding of the world, in the case of scientific photography
          or photojournalism. Photography is also an artistic medium—the Photographer presents their interpretation of
           the human experience through what they choose to document and the perspective their photos show.

        Another important aspect of photography is that photographic images can be reproduced, allowing them to be circulated
         and distributed worldwide. Even before digital photography, a film photograph was easier to reproduce than the paintings
          and drawings that had previously been the best way to convey an image. One early example of how the new technology of 
          photography rapidly came to shape the world is the work of Matthew Brady. His photos documenting the American Civil War
           showed the brutality of the war’s impact, powerfully influencing public opinion about the conflict.</p>
